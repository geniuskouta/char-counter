# Character Counter🥰
Character counter is useful for counting Japanese, Chinese and Korean characters where multibyte characters are used. Usually, people want to count half-width and full-width differently because a half-width character takes up less space.

## Count characters by its type😝
It counts characters by its type. The rule below applies:
- 2 half-width characters equal 1
- 1 full-width character equal 1.

## Max length😶
It sets max length by the same count method applied for half-width and full-width. On the other hand, HTML5 input attribute's maxlength counts by the string length.
